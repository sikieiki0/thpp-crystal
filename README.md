**`Touhou Puppet Play: Crystal`** is a work-in-progress project that ports the Johto region and storyline to a Generation III-style engine, with all Pok√©mon-related content replaced by characters and elements from the Touhou Project.  
All outdoor Johto maps have been inserted using FireRed-style tiles as a baseline.  
All Pok√©mon species have been replaced with Touhou puppets, referred to as Bon√©ka.  
However, scripting and battle functionality have not yet been implemented, so this is not a playable ROM hack at this stage.  
This project is currently focused on foundational work such as maps, graphics, and data structures, with gameplay systems to follow in later stages.

Touhoumon, also known as Touhou Puppet Play (Êù±Êñπ‰∫∫ÂΩ¢Âäá, Touhou Ningyougeki), is a series of Pok√©mon ROM hacks that replace Pok√©mon with characters from the Touhou Project series.  
Instead of catching and battling Pok√©mon, you collect and train puppet-like versions of Touhou characters (originally referred to as Fragments in early games).
